# LipRead Intelligence: Advanced Deep Learning for Silent Speech Decoding

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a silent speech decoding system using deep learning techniques, specifically a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The goal is to enhance speech recognition in noisy environments, enabling effective communication without relying on audio signals.

## Key Features
- **CNN-LSTM Model:** Utilized CNN for feature extraction and LSTM for sequential learning to decode silent speech from visual inputs.
- **Noisy Environment Adaptation:** The model was designed to work effectively even in noisy environments where traditional speech recognition methods may struggle.
